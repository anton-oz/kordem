#### simplify PianoEngine into more specialized sub classes

- [ ] in the chords array have the chords be objects with the name and then an array of the intervals of the chord

#### more chord building tools for user

- [ ] store settings in a cookie and have the initial state be the last selected input

- [ ] add extended chords

- [ ] able to set custom number of octaves

- [ ] have chord inversions

- [ ] if the piano is showing one octave, render the keyboard
      with the selected note as the first note and render the 12 keys
      from that note.

## make key dimensions better

#### real world size for ratio

- white key width = 2.2cm

- black key width = 0.9cm

- 12 keys width = 16.3 cm

- gap between keys
